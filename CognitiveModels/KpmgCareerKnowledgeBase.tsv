Does KPMG give more credit to students who do extracurricular activities?	We do not automatically give credit to such students simply because they are involved in many extracurricular or social activities. The only way that such experience comes into play is when it provides evidence of the skills and behaviours required within KPMG globally. Those involved in fewer extracurricular activities may be able to prove themselves in other ways if their area of interest is relevant to KPMG.	https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/careers/graduates/faqs-general-questions.html	type:general	[]	false	[]	5
Does KPMG have a preference for postgraduates as opposed to undergraduates?	No, we treat all graduates equally.

Why does KPMG use assessment tests as a selection method?	An assessment test measures the ability to acquire further knowledge or skills in a specific area. KPMG asks you to sit this test to ensure that all candidates are treated EQUALLY. It will give us a fair and objective assessment of a candidate in numerical, verbal, logical reasoning and situational judgement ability. The test has proved extremely reliable and valid. It assesses abilities relevant for the post for which you have applied; research shows those who did well in the tests were high performers in their future work. We also find that we gain information from these tests which cannot accurately be gained from other parts of the selection process, such as the interview.	https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/careers/graduates/faqs-general-questions.html	type:assessment	[]	false	[]	15
What is the assessment test about?	The test consists of four parts: verbal reasoning, numerical reasoning, deductive-logical thinking and situational judgement tests.	https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/careers/graduates/faqs-general-questions.html	type:assessment	[]	false	[]	16
What are the numerical, verbal reasoning, deductive-logical thinking and situational judgement tests assessing?	The numerical reasoning tests are designed to measure your ability to make correct decisions or inferences from numerical or statistical data. The tests are intended to measure a candidate's ability to cope with figures in a practical and realistic context.\n\n The verbal reasoning tests are designed not only to measure the application of English ability in a realistic context, but also to measure the ability to evaluate the logic of various kinds of arguments.\n\n The deductive-logical thinking tests are designed to measure your problem solving and decision making skills.\n\nThe situational judgement tests present candidates with realistic, hypothetical and challenging situations that employees might encounter at work.	https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/careers/graduates/faqs-general-questions.html	type:assessment	[]	false	[]	17
What methods does KPMG use to score candidates? Do you count the rate of right and wrong answers? Will marks be deducted for wrong answers?	Unfortunately our scoring methodology is confidential. Try not to worry about this when taking the test – just relax and do your best.	https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/careers/graduates/faqs-general-questions.html	type:assessment	[]	false	[]	18
